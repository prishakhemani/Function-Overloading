# Function-Overloading
Function Overloading is defined as the process of having two or more function with the same name, but different in parameters is known as function overloading in C++. In function overloading, the function is redefined by using either different types of arguments or a different number of arguments. It is only through these differences compiler can differentiate between the functions.

# Rules of Function Overloading in C++

Different parameters or three different conditions :

1.  These  functions have different parameter type

sum(int a, int b)

sum(double a, double b)


2.   These functions have a different number of parameters

sum(int a, int b)

sum(int a, int b, int c)


3.  These functions have a different sequence of parameters

sum(int a, double b)

sum(double a, int b)
